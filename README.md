This repository contains the configuration and documentation of the Ansible collection `ans2dev.general` and is made available through `GitHub Pages`.

The documentation is generated in `rst` format using `antsibull-docs` and `Sphinx` to compile the HTML structure.

The documentation comes from the Ansible collection, so it is regenerated and updated only after a new version is released.
